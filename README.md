# SchedulVis

## Project Description

SchedulVis is an interactive tool designed to help users understand and compare different scheduling algorithms through visual representations. This project aims to demystify the complexities of scheduling algorithms by providing an intuitive, visual approach to learning and analysis, all implemented using C++ and an open-source C++ GUI library.

## Features
* Interactive Visualizations: View and interact with graphical representations of various scheduling algorithms.
* Algorithm Comparison: Easily compare the performance and behavior of different scheduling algorithms side-by-side.
* Step-by-Step Execution: Follow the execution of algorithms step-by-step to see how decisions are made in real-time.
* Customizable Parameters: Adjust parameters such as job arrival times, execution times, and priorities to see how they affect scheduling.
* Educational Insights: Gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each scheduling algorithm with clear, visual explanations.
  
## Supported Scheduling Algorithms

* First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
* Shortest Job Next (SJN)
* Priority Scheduling
* Round Robin (RR)
* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  
## Technologies Used

* C++: Core logic and algorithm implementation.
* Open Source C++ GUI Library: For creating interactive and user-friendly graphical interfaces (e.g., Qt, wxWidgets, or Dear ImGui).
